title: "SAVVY: Survival analysis for AdVerse events with VarYing follow-up times"

# The SAVVY project

The SAVVY project is a consortium of academic and pharmaceutical industry partners that aims to improve the analyses of adverse event (AE) data in clinical trials through the use of survival techniques appropriately dealing with varying follow-up times and competing events. Although statistical methodologies have advanced, in AE analyses often the incidence proportion, the incidence density or a non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator are used, which either ignore censoring or competing events. In an empirical study including randomized clinical trials from several sponsor companies, these potential sources of bias are investigated.

for (i in 1:length(packs.html)){library(packs.html[i], character.only = TRUE)}

## roster

roster <- as.data.frame(read_excel(paste(path, "/data/roster.xlsx", sep = ""), col_types = NULL))
```

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
kable(roster)
```

# Impact

Besides [publications](publications.html) SAVVY has already made it into a standard text book on drug development, see p. 486/7 in [Statistical Issues in Drug Development (3rd ed)](http://www.senns.uk/SIDD.html) by [Stephen Senn](https://www.senns.uk/):
