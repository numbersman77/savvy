    "text": "Background\nThe assessment of safety is an important aspect of the evaluation of new therapies in clinical trials, with analyses of adverse events being an essential part of this. Standard methods for the analysis of adverse events such as the incidence proportion, i.e. the number of patients with a specific adverse event out of all patients in the treatment groups, do not account for both varying follow-up times and competing risks. Alternative approaches such as the Aalen-Johansen estimator of the cumulative incidence function have been suggested. Theoretical arguments and numerical evaluations support the application of these more advanced methodology, but as yet there is to our knowledge only insufficient empirical evidence whether these methods would lead to different conclusions in safety evaluations. The Survival analysis for AdVerse events with VarYing follow-up times (SAVVY) project strives to close this gap in evidence by conducting a meta-analytical study to assess the impact of the methodology on the conclusion of the safety assessment empirically. Three papers summarize the rationale and results of the project (for all SAVVY papers see publications):\n\nStegherr, Beyersmann, et al. (2021): Statistical analysis plan, presenting the rationale and statistical concept of the empirical study conducted as part of the SAVVY project.

(2021): 1-sample case, compares estimators of AE risk in one treatment arm. arxiv | publication\nRufibach et al. (2023): 2-sample case, compares relative risk estimators comparing two treatment arms based on (1) AE probabilities and (2) hazards. arxiv | publication\n\n\n\nSAS code\nThe original SAS macros that were used by each sponsor to generate the summary data for the meta-analysis is available as supplement to Stegherr, Beyersmann, et al.

    "text": "The SAVVY project\nThe SAVVY project is a consortium of academic and pharmaceutical industry partners that aims to improve the analyses of adverse event (AE) data in clinical trials through the use of survival techniques appropriately dealing with varying follow-up times and competing events. Although statistical methodologies have advanced, in AE analyses often the incidence proportion, the incidence density or a non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator are used, which either ignore censoring or competing events. In an empirical study including randomized clinical trials from several sponsor companies, these potential sources of bias are investigated.\n\n\nSteering committee\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst\nLast\nInstitution\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nJan\nBeyersmann\nUniversity of Ulm\nUlm\n\n\nTim\nFriede\nUniversity of Göttingen\nGöttingen\n\n\nValentine\nJehl\nNovartis\nBasel\n\n\nFriedhelm\nLeverkus\nPfizer\nBerlin\n\n\nKaspar\nRufibach\nRoche\nBasel\n\n\nClaudia\nSchmoor\nUniversity of Freiburg\nFreiburg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact\nBesides publications SAVVY has already made it into a standard text book on drug development, see p. 486/7 in Statistical Issues in Drug Development (3rd ed) by Stephen Senn:\n\n\n\n\nThe general interest around quantification of risk in clinical trials is also exemplified by the reactions to this linkedin post: Within a week, the post generated &gt;30’000 views and just short of 300 likes.\n\n\nContact\nReach out to Kaspar Rufibach with comments and suggestions on this webpage.\n\n\nUpdates of this page\n\n28/02/2024: Added link to preprint of SAVVY overview paper to publications.\n21/02/2024: savvyr R package uploaded to CRAN.\n24/11/2022: initial version online"
